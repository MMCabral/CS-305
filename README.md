# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a webbased company that handles the finances of many clients from all over the world and they requested me to find them the best software
  for security in order to keep their clients feeling safe and secure with dealing with Artemis Financial.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  - I did a really good job with finding the very best security for Artemis Financial that would cover their every need. Coding securely is very important because
  you need to avoid the possibilities of someone being able to crack your code and get access to private information. Adding security measures to this company adds the
  value of being able to trust them.
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
 - Deciphering the dependancy report was the most challenging for me 
 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - I increased layers of security but addressing the issues shown in the dependancy report and made sure to go through them one by one and find solutions to
  the hazards
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - After refactoring the code I ran another dependancy check to look for possible new threats and compaired my reports to make sure I did not add new hazards
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - I used resources from my class and youtube any time I struggled with getting my software to work. One coding practice I use is to know when to step away from
  my code whenever I find myself being stumped, I find its easier to take a second and gather my thoughts before continuing
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - I would show a future employer the amount of research I went through in order to complete this report and would show them my ability to run a dependancy check and decipher it.
